# mpad
A working memory game based on n-backs

How to Play:

Click the squares in the order indicated by the numbers. Pay attention to the red square as it moves and make sure you click however many positions back it is set to. How many positions back you should press is indicated by the numbers on the pad. To make the game easier/more difficult, you can click on the "+" and "-" buttons.

Enabling the "Helper" option will show all the previous positions of the red square as green squares. By using this option, you'll know to click on a green square and not any of the white squares.
